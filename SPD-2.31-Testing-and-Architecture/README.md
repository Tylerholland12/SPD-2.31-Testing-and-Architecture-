# SPD 2.31 Testing and Architecture

## Course Description

This course focuses on advanced topics such as debugging, unit testing, refactoring and design patterns. Students apply these concepts to existing portfolio projects to improve code qualities such as readibility, modularity and extensibility. Topics covered include: debugging techniques, unit-testing, refactoring techniques, design patterns and navigating massive codebases. By the end of the course, students have practical knowledge of writing python unit tests, refactoring legacy code and implementing some desing patterns. 

## Prerequisites

- CS 1.0 - INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING
- CS 1.1 - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: hybrid | 7 weeks | 14 sessions

## Assignment Schedule

We will be using Gradescope, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at https://gradescope.com/reset_password. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

The assingments cover debugging, refactoring, unit testing and architecture topics. The following is the list of assignment titles:
1. Debugging: Gathering info and writing assumptions
1. Refactoring - PEP 8: Improving Code Readibility Using PEP 8. The assingments cover indentation, whitespaces, naming convention and docstrings.
1. Refactoring - Composing Methods. The assignments cover various techniques including extract method, replace temp with query, introducing explaining variable, split temp variable and 'remove assingment to method parameters'.
1. Refactoring - Moving Features and Organizing Data. The assingments include techniques such as extract class, Replace Magic numbers with constants.
1. Refactoring - Simplifying Conditional Expressions. The assingments include techniques such as decompose conditional, consolidate conditionals, consolidate duplicates, remove control flags and Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses.
1. Refactoring - Other techniques. The assignment includes extract superclass technique.
1. Unit Test 1 and Unit Test 2. The assingments include writing unit tests for a tic-toc-toe program.
1. Architecture 1 and 2. The assingments include refactoring a program to use the observer pattern and finite state machine pattern. 

Please refer to [refactoring tutorial and exercises](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/SPD-2.31-Testing-and-Architecture/tree/master/lab/refactoring) and [sample-exercises.md](sample-exercises.md) for details.
For assingments due dates please refer to Gradescope. As a rule of thumb, the due date of an assignment is one to two weeks after its corresponding lesson is taught.
