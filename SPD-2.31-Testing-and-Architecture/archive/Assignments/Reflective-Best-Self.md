# Reflected Best Self
This activity is adapted off of resources from University of Michigan 

**Due Date:** May 8th

**Step 1: Identify Respondents and Ask for Feedback About Your STRENGTHS**
Only solicit feedback from those who know you best -- classmates, family, friends, and teachers. This can be done effectively using electronic communication, whereby results can be easily copied and pasted into a table for analysis. Ask these individuals to provide information about your strengths, only, including specific examples of ways in which you used these strengths that were meaningful to them. You may be uncomfortable asking exclusively for positive feedback, but remember that the exercise will help you improve your performance. 

Remember this is strengths for you as a person, not exclusively as a software engineer. There may (and most likely will) be overlap though. A great software engineer will draw from qualities that make them a great person.

**Step 2: Recognize Patterns**
Use the feedback from respondents to identify common themes or areas of strength. Add examples of your own and organize the information into a table following the general format of the following example illustration. Please use your own themes from the feedback that you receive. 

This analysis step can be very insightful. It will help you develop a larger picture of your capabilities and an opportunity to evaluate or reevaluate your skills.



***Example Table***

| Common Strength        | Example Given by whom           | Take away  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|   Work Ethic  | Julie remembered "You woke up at 6am every morning to study. I've also noticed that you study before and after class to best learn the material"      |  I effectively make time to learn and grow   |
| Kind |        |     |
|  Supportive   |        |     |
|   Debugger champ  | Jessica said, "I had a bug in my python homework that I spent 1 hour to solve and couldn't figure it out. You sat wiht me and we spent a whole other hour and a half to figure it out. I wanted to go to bed but you insisted that we figure out the issue. We finally found it - after doing a bunch of searching through StackOverflow. I was super grateful for your help."        |  I persist and don't give up easily   |
|  Passionate   |        |     |
|  Clear commenting   |        |     |
|  etc ...   |        |     |


**Step 3: Compose Your Best-Self Portrait**
Write a description of yourself that summarizes what the analysis revealed, weaving the themes from the feedback and your own observations into a composite of your “personal best.” It should be a prose composition approximately three paragraphs long. Please begin the first paragraph with the statement “When I am at my best, I…” This will take time and careful consideration but should provide an image of who you are now, and who you can become. 

**Step 4: Reflect. What Has Your Best-Self Portrait Revealed About the Career Path You Are On or Would Like to Define?** 
Put a link to your Reflective Best Self in the course tracker, and discuss your results with your coach. Make sure to configure your sharing/viewing permissions so that at least instructors and your coach can view it.
