## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Formally define the word _pseudocode_ and recognize it's role in solving  engineering problems.
2. Identify the prime way to enhance developer productivity when constructing software.

## Initial Exercise (15 min)

1. **Think**: Write down the three biggest things that **would help you to write code faster**.
2. **Pair**: Share and **discuss the three things you wrote down with a partner**.
3. **Share**: We'll **go around the room and discuss what you wrote down** as a class!

## TT I: Collaborative Development IRL (15 min)

All of us, even if we don't know it, are subject the same golden rule of software engineering:

> *General Principle of Software Quality*:
>
> _The reduction in the number of bugs yields improvement in overall development time_.

Want proof?

1. At IBM: each hour of inspection **prevented about 100 hours of related work** (Holland 1999).
2. Raytheon reduced its cost due to rework from about **40 percent** of total project cost **to about 20 percent** through an initiative that focused on code review and inspection (Haley 1996).
3. In a software-maintenance organization, **55 percent of one-line maintenance changes were in error before code reviews** were introduced. **After reviews** were introduced, **only 2 percent of the changes were in error**. **Before reviews were introduced, under 20 percent were correct the first time**.

### Quick Q&A

What's the common link? Write down your answer.

_Pair programming. Extreme programming. Mentorship. Apprenticeship. Open source contributions. Hackathons. Networking events. Technical meetups._

I will reveal your answer after break!

## BREAK (10 min)

## TT II: A Conclusion on Collaboration (10 min)

### Answer

Revealed after break!

**These formal engineering techniques (and more) grant opportunities for fresh eyes to grace your codebase, and catching bugs and errors in your thinking that WILL surprise you.** Bugs even your tests won't catch!

### That Means...

Revealed after break!

 **Interacting with other programmers is required**. The best programmers you know gained their skills through the collaboration, pairing, and taking swift and thoughtful action upon feedback --- including yours truly!

### Final Note

What can we conclude from the information above? Is there a short, memorable takeaway that always works? I'm glad you asked!

Ready?

_**COLLABORATION REDUCES BUGS**._

**_That's it. Say it with me our loud. Again. This is your new mantra!_**

### Key Takeaways on Collaboration

* **Better code arises from** multiple sets of eyes seeing the code** and **multiple programmers working on the code**.
* The **impact of someone leaving the project is lessened because multiple people are familiar** with each section of code.
* **Defect** (bug-fixing) **cycles are shorter overall** because any of several programmers can potentially be assigned to fix bugs when they're available.

## TT III: Pseudocode for Pros (15 min)

> The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what you are trying to build. - Bjarne Stroustrup

Use the [mind map](https://make-school-courses.github.io/SPD-1.4-Testing-And-Architecture/Resources/2-PseudocodeForPros.pdf) to summarize the steps in building classes and routines (another word for _functions_). Additionally, go over the PPP strategy outlined in the map.

## In Class Activity II (15 min)

### Prep for Lab

Be ready next class period with a function you wrote in your intensive project. We'll be diving deep to solving real-world problems hands-on during next class's Pseudocode Lab!

### Add Deliverable to Course Tracker

Add a link to the code you want to re-architect via pseudocode in the [Progress Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12DDJDz73An4knCUSQMOLK0EBQD-jzM90Z1PauibzADY/edit#gid=136456159). Dani will follow up and review the code before the next class period, and will be messaging anyone who didn't complete the deliverable at 5pm today!
