# Themes in Software Craftsmanship ([video of lecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z9KLW7IR6KnXKK58Gf8DV6VQB8l0Rj8A/view?usp=sharing)) + ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_4_29))

## Why you should know this or industry application (5 min)

This will help you reduce the complexity of your code, and beware of potential pitfalls that you can run into as a software engineer. You'll be able to easily identify good code from bad code, and will have a better understanding of the available conventions to use at your discretion

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Reduce the complexity of your code
1. Decide how and when to follow and break conventions
1. Identify markers of poor software quality

## Activity - Conquering Complexity (5 min)

Everyone write down 6 things that reduce complexity in your code

## TT - Conquering Complexity (5 min)

Discuss [various techniques](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_4_6) engineers can use to reduce complexity

# Activity - Conventions (5 min)

Ask the class: What are some examples of conventions in software development? When is it good to keep conventions? When is it good to break them?

# TT - Conventions (5 min)

[Discuss the pros and cons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_0_100) of conventions

## TT - Process (5 min)

If youâ€™re trying to figure out how to use a convention, what may help is implementing a process

Here are some [examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_4_13) of processes used in and out of software development

## Activity - Create a Process (10 min)

Draw your own process for writing software. You should use the following components at a minimum

- Error Handling
- Software Architecture
- Writing Tests
- Pseudocode
- Coding

Put your final drawing in slack

## Break (5 min)

## TT - Falling Rocks (5 min)

[Describe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_0_125) what a "falling rock" is in software development, and provide a few examples.

Ask the class to come up with some of their own examples of "falling rocks"

# TT - Program into your language (5 min)

The main idea is to not let language restrictions stop you from innovating

If you're missing functionality, build out what you need!

## Activity - Write programs for people, not computers (10 min)

Follow this [partner activity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_0_77) to improve the readability of your codebase.

## TT - Thou Shalt Render Software and Religion Asunder + Iterate (5 min)

Use all the tools in your toolbelt! Don't limit yourself unnecessarily. Always do your research and pick the right tool for the job

Constantly iterate and improve your work!

## Refactor Activity (45 min)

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERErlV1z4AhkvWi6vvFYaaZ3YKAzS2WphQDRR0dQgR0/edit#slide=id.g56528dfe23_4_20), and put your refactor plan and refactor code in the progress tracker before next class!
