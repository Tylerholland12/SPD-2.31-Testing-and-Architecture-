## Calculator Refactor

Often in an interview, as well as on the job, you'll be asked to refactor existing code. We'll practice this by looking at this [really bad python calculator code](https://github.com/sobolevn/python-code-disasters/blob/master/python/my_first_calculator.py).

1. Review the code
1. Think about how you would refactor it, write a high-level plan
1. Write out pseudocode for your refactor
